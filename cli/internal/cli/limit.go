// has read it everywhere, and a divergence between two commands is invisible in
// help because both rows still read the same.

// count owes. pflag has no minimum, so the parser is this Set method: without
// it a -1 reaches a slice expression, and `items[:-1]` panics where a usage
// error was the answer.
//
// Type returns "int" so a --limit renders as one in help and reads back as one.
// limitFlag takes the value off this struct rather than through the name, so
// nothing depends on that string matching what pflag's own accessors expect.
