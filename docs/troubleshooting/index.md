This comprehensive troubleshooting guide documents common issues, their root causes, attempted solutions, and final resolutions encountered during the development and operation of the iChrisBirch project.

## Overview

The troubleshooting documentation is organized by component and includes:

- **Problem description**: Clear statement of the issue
- **Root cause analysis**: Technical explanation of why the issue occurs
- **Attempted solutions**: What was tried and why it didn't work
- **Final resolution**: Working solution with implementation details
- **Prevention**: How to avoid the issue in the future

## Quick Reference

### Common Issues by Component

| Component | Common Issues | Quick Solutions |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| [Docker](docker-issues.md) | Build failures, container networking | Check Dockerfile syntax, network configuration |
| [Poetry to UV Migration](poetry-uv-migration.md) | Dependency management, virtual environments | Follow migration checklist |
| [Testing](testing-issues.md) | Test failures, pytest not found, Docker issues | Verify test dependencies, rebuild images |
| [Database](database-issues.md) | Connection errors, schema issues | Check connection strings, run migrations |
| [Development Environment](development-issues.md) | Setup problems, tooling conflicts | Follow setup guide step-by-step |

### Recent Critical Issues (July 2025)

**Docker Network Conflicts During Testing:**

- **Issue**: Test runs fail with "failed to set up container networking: network not found" errors
- **Resolution**: Implemented comprehensive cleanup function with pre/post cleanup and multiple fallback strategies
- **Details**: [Docker Network Conflicts](testing-issues.md#docker-network-conflicts-during-testing)

**Testing Infrastructure Failures:**

- `error: Failed to spawn: 'pytest'` → Missing `--group test` in Dockerfile
- `service has neither an image nor a build context` → Add build directive to compose services  
- `ModuleNotFoundError: tests.utils.environment` → Fix import paths in conftest.py
- Docker network conflicts → Run comprehensive Docker cleanup

See [Testing Issues - Recent Critical Issues](testing-issues.md#recent-critical-issues-july-2025) for detailed solutions.
