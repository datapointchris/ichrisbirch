# CLI Management Guide

This guide covers the comprehensive CLI interface for managing the iChrisBirch application using modern Traefik deployment.

## 🚀 Quick Reference

```bash
# Start any environment (uses Traefik + HTTPS by default)
ichrisbirch dev start               # Development environment
ichrisbirch testing start          # Testing environment
ichrisbirch prod start             # Production environment

# Check status with URLs
ichrisbirch dev status

# Run health checks
ichrisbirch dev health

# SSL certificate management
ichrisbirch ssl-manager <command> <env>
```

## 📋 Modern CLI Architecture

The CLI has been **completely refactored** to eliminate confusing command duplication. The following changes have been made:

### ✅ **What Changed**

- **Removed all `traefik-*` commands** that duplicated regular environment commands
- **Updated all environment commands** (`dev`, `testing`, `prod`) to use **Traefik + HTTPS by default**
- **Made `ssl-manager` a top-level command** for certificate management
- **Simplified the interface** to hide implementation details from users

### ❌ **Removed Commands (No Longer Needed)**

- `ichrisbirch traefik start <env>` → Use `ichrisbirch <env> start`
- `ichrisbirch traefik stop <env>` → Use `ichrisbirch <env> stop`
- `ichrisbirch traefik status <env>` → Use `ichrisbirch <env> status`
- `ichrisbirch traefik health <env>` → Use `ichrisbirch <env> health`
- `ichrisbirch traefik logs <env>` → Use `ichrisbirch <env> logs`

## 🔧 Environment Management Commands

### Development Environment

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `dev start` | Start development with HTTPS | `ichrisbirch dev start` |
| `dev stop` | Stop development environment | `ichrisbirch dev stop` |
| `dev restart` | Restart development environment | `ichrisbirch dev restart` |
| `dev rebuild` | Rebuild images, restart, and initialize database | `ichrisbirch dev rebuild` |
| `dev status` | Show service status, URLs, and credentials | `ichrisbirch dev status` |
| `dev logs` | View service logs | `ichrisbirch dev logs [service]` |
| `dev health` | Run comprehensive health checks | `ichrisbirch dev health` |

**Dev Credentials Display:**

The `dev start`, `dev status`, and `dev rebuild` commands now display development credentials from the `.env` file:

```text
Dev Credentials:
  Regular: user@example.com / password123
  Admin:   admin@example.com / adminpass123
```

### Testing Environment

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `test run` | Run tests (reuses containers) | `ichrisbirch test run [path] [args]` |
| `test cov` | Run tests with coverage | `ichrisbirch test cov` |
| `testing start` | Start testing environment | `ichrisbirch testing start` |
| `testing stop` | Stop testing environment | `ichrisbirch testing stop` |
| `testing restart` | Restart testing environment | `ichrisbirch testing restart` |
| `testing status` | Show service status and HTTPS URLs | `ichrisbirch testing status` |
| `testing logs` | View service logs | `ichrisbirch testing logs [service]` |
| `testing health` | Run comprehensive health checks | `ichrisbirch testing health` |

**Test Run Behavior:**

The `test run` command reuses running containers and cleans the database:

1. **Reuses containers** - Starts test containers only if not already running
2. **Cleans database** - TRUNCATE (not drop/recreate) preserves schema, re-inserts lookup data and users
3. **No stale connections** - API container's connection pool stays valid across test runs
4. **Fast** - Sub-second database clean vs seconds for drop/recreate

> **Note:** Test and dev environments use separate proxy networks (`proxy-test` and `proxy-dev`) to avoid Traefik routing conflicts when running simultaneously.

### Production Environment

All production commands are **blue/green aware** — they automatically detect the active deployment color and act on the correct containers. See [Blue/Green Deployment](blue-green-deployment.md) for the full guide.

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `prod start` | Start infra + active color | `ichrisbirch prod start` |
| `prod stop` | Stop active color + infra | `ichrisbirch prod stop` |
| `prod restart` | Restart active color + infra | `ichrisbirch prod restart` |
| `prod status` | Show infra + active color status | `ichrisbirch prod status` |
| `prod logs` | View active color logs | `ichrisbirch prod logs [service]` |
| `prod logs deploy` | View deployment event logs | `ichrisbirch prod logs deploy` |
| `prod logs build` | View latest Docker build log | `ichrisbirch prod logs build` |
| `prod health` | Run health checks | `ichrisbirch prod health` |
| `prod smoke` | Run smoke tests against all endpoints | `ichrisbirch prod smoke` |
| `prod deploy-status` | Show blue/green state and routing | `ichrisbirch prod deploy-status` |
| `prod rollback` | Switch traffic to previous color | `ichrisbirch prod rollback` |
| `prod build-test` | Test production Docker build locally | `ichrisbirch prod build-test` |

### SSL Certificate Management

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `ssl-manager generate` | Generate SSL certificates with mkcert | `ichrisbirch ssl-manager generate dev` |
| `ssl-manager validate` | Validate existing certificates | `ichrisbirch ssl-manager validate dev` |
| `ssl-manager info` | Show certificate information | `ichrisbirch ssl-manager info dev` |
| `ssl-manager help` | Show SSL manager help | `ichrisbirch ssl-manager help` |

## 🔒 SSL Certificate Management with mkcert

### Modern Browser-Trusted Certificates

The SSL manager now uses **mkcert** when available to generate **browser-trusted certificates** that work without security warnings.

#### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install mkcert (macOS)
brew install mkcert

# Install mkcert (Linux)
curl -JLO "https://dl.filippo.io/mkcert/latest?for=linux/amd64"
chmod +x mkcert-v*-linux-amd64
sudo cp mkcert-v*-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/mkcert

# Install the local CA
mkcert -install
```

#### Generate Certificates

```bash
# Generate certificates for development
ichrisbirch ssl-manager generate dev

# Generate certificates for all environments
ichrisbirch ssl-manager generate all

# View certificate information
ichrisbirch ssl-manager info dev
```

#### What mkcert Provides

- **Browser-trusted certificates**: No security warnings in Chrome, Safari, Firefox
- **Proper Subject Alternative Names**: Wildcard + specific subdomains
- **Local Certificate Authority**: Installed in system trust stores
- **Long validity**: Certificates valid for 2+ years

#### Certificate Domains

**Development certificates include:**

- `docker.localhost`
- `*.docker.localhost`
- `api.docker.localhost`
- `app.docker.localhost`
- `chat.docker.localhost`
- `dashboard.docker.localhost`

## 🚀 Detailed Command Reference

### `ichrisbirch dev start`

   # Stop conflicting services
   ichrisbirch dev stop
   docker stop $(docker ps -q --filter "name=ichrisbirch")

   # Restart
   ichrisbirch dev start
   ```

3. **DNS resolution issues**

   ```bash
   # Check /etc/hosts
   grep docker.localhost /etc/hosts

   # Add missing entries (for development)
   echo "127.0.0.1 api.docker.localhost" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
   echo "127.0.0.1 app.docker.localhost" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
   echo "127.0.0.1 chat.docker.localhost" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
   echo "127.0.0.1 dashboard.docker.localhost" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
   ```

4. **Certificate issues in browsers**

   ```bash
   # Install mkcert if not already installed
   brew install mkcert
   mkcert -install

   # Regenerate certificates with mkcert
   ichrisbirch ssl-manager generate dev

   # Restart to pick up new certificates
   ichrisbirch dev restart
   ```

5. **Browser still shows certificate warnings**

   ```bash
   # Verify mkcert is working
   mkcert -install

   # Check certificate details
   ichrisbirch ssl-manager info dev

   # Clear browser cache and restart browser
   # Chrome: Settings > Privacy > Clear browsing data
   ```

### Getting Help

```bash
# Show general help
ichrisbirch help

# Show environment-specific help
ichrisbirch dev help

2. **Use Docker BuildKit**: Enable for faster builds
3. **Persist volumes**: Avoid unnecessary data recreation

### Monitoring Performance

```bash
# Check container resource usage
docker stats

# Monitor service response times (with trusted certificates)
time curl -I https://api.docker.localhost/health

# View Traefik metrics
curl https://dashboard.docker.localhost/api/overview
```

## 🌟 Benefits of the Simplified CLI

### Before (Confusing Duplication)

- `ichrisbirch traefik start dev` vs `ichrisbirch dev start` (both did the same thing)
- Users had to understand Traefik implementation details
- Inconsistent command patterns
- Implementation details exposed in user interface

### After (Clean & Simple)

- **Single command per operation**: `ichrisbirch dev start`
- **Implementation details hidden**: Users don't need to know about Traefik
- **Consistent patterns**: All environments work the same way
- **Modern HTTPS by default**: No separate "traefik" commands needed

### User Experience Improvements

- **Faster onboarding**: New developers don't need to understand reverse proxy details
- **Reduced cognitive load**: Fewer commands to remember
- **Better discoverability**: `ichrisbirch help` shows all available commands clearly
- **Professional CLI patterns**: Follows industry-standard CLI design principles

The simplified CLI provides a clean, professional interface that hides implementation complexity while providing powerful functionality for managing the modern Traefik-based deployment architecture.
