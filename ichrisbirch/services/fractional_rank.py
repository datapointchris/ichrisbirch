"""Order a table's rows by a float `rank`, the way Linear's `sortOrder` does.

A new row goes one past the last. A move takes the midpoint of its two new
neighbors, so it writes one row. Halving a gap runs out of precision eventually,
so when the gap left between two neighbors falls below `MIN_GAP`, every rank in
the table is renumbered to whole numbers in its current order and the midpoint
is taken again.

One rank space covers the whole table, even where rows are shown in groups. A
row placed after its neighbor A lands between A and whatever ranks next in the
table, and nothing in A's group can sit between those two.
