"""Row capping for the collection reads, with one meaning for zero.

`cli-design.md` § "`--follow`/`-f` defaults to false; `--limit`/`-n` goes on
every list" puts a limit on every list over data that grows outside the binary,
which is every collection this API answers. Capping here rather than in each
client is `data.md` § "Filtering is server-side": the rows the caller discards
are rows nobody had to serialize.

**Absence means no cap and zero means no rows.** `cli-design.md` § "A sentinel
never steals a value the caller can mean" is the rule: a reserved value has to
be one no caller could have meant, and `tail -n 0` settles that a caller can
mean zero rows. So `limit` omitted leaves the query uncapped, and `limit=0`
reaches `LIMIT 0` and returns an empty set. One helper is what keeps every
endpoint on the same side of that.

A negative limit is rejected at the edge by `ge=0` rather than reaching SQL.
