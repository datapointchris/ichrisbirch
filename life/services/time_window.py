"""Narrowing a list read to the rows dated inside a window of instants.

A window is half-open. `since` is the first instant inside it and `until` the
first instant past it, so a day's window is its first instant to the next day's
and a row stamped at midnight belongs to one day only. Either bound narrows on
its own, which leaves the other end open.

The client resolves a span, a day or an instant to an instant before it calls,
so no duration and no bare day reaches this module. The filter runs in the
query rather than in each client, so the CLI and the web client share one
meaning of a window.

A row with no date compares as null, so it is outside every window: an unread
article was not "read this week".
